## Something about me
**Hello, world!** I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at UCSD where ~~my code is cleaner than my room and~~ my ideas are as charged as my laptopâ€”*always 100%*. I live by the creed **"eat, sleep, code, repeat,"** with a sprinkle of chaos to keep things interesting. I believe in making code not just work, but dance. Less bugs, more fun!
